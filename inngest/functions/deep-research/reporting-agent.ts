STAGE ANALYSES:
${stageAnalyses

DRAFT REPORT:
${draftReport}

Your task is to edit, expand, and polish this report into a final version that MAINTAINS ALL EXISTING INLINE CITATION NUMBERS AND THE REFERENCES LIST. Do NOT change citation numbers or add new ones. You may move sentences but keep citations next to the facts they support.

The revised report should:
1. STRUCTURE & FLOW
- Reorganize sections if needed for better logical flow
- Add transitions between sections
- Create a compelling narrative arc from introduction through conclusion
- Draw connections between different sections where relevant

2. CONTENT ENHANCEMENT
- Expand sections that need more depth
- Add cross-references between related points in different sections
- Synthesize insights across sections
- Add new sections or subsections if needed to explore important connections
- Ensure the report is AT LEAST as long as the source material, preferably longer
- Draw on the stage analyses to add relevant details that may have been missed

3. INTRODUCTION & CONCLUSION
- Write a new, engaging introduction that sets up the entire report
- Create a comprehensive conclusion that synthesizes all key findings
- Ensure both connect strongly to the main body

4. ACADEMIC QUALITY
- Maintain formal academic tone
- Strengthen argumentation and evidence
- Add nuance and qualification where needed
- Ensure proper citation of sources and findings

5. FORMATTING
- Use clear markdown formatting
- Add section numbers if appropriate
- Include a table of contents
- Use consistent heading levels

The final version should be a substantial expansion of the draft that creates a cohesive, authoritative research document. Feel free to reorganize and expand the content significantly while preserving the core insights.

Generate the complete polished report now, starting with a table of contents.`,
