            Create a systematic research plan with exactly ${stageCount} distinct stages that will thoroughly explore this topic. Each stage should represent a unique analytical approach and build upon insights from previous stages to create a comprehensive understanding.

            Design the stages to progress logically from foundational understanding to advanced insights:
            - Early stages should establish fundamental knowledge and context
            - Middle stages should explore specific aspects, applications, or implications  
            - Later stages should synthesize insights and examine broader implications
            
            For each stage, you must also generate exactly ${queriesPerStage} specific research queries that can be effectively researched using web search. These queries should:
            - Be focused and concrete (not too broad or general)
            - Address different aspects of that stage's focus area
            - Be phrased as specific questions that will yield useful search results
            - Include detailed reasoning explaining their importance to the stage
            - Collectively provide comprehensive coverage of the stage's key aspects

            Ensure the stages are diverse, complementary, and together provide a thorough exploration of the topic that will result in a comprehensive research report.

            Remember: Each query will be used for web searches, so make them specific enough to find relevant, high-quality sources while being broad enough to capture important information about that aspect of the topic.
